_A [heat map](https://bostadsbussen.se/sold/map) of apartment prices in central Stockholm_

Disclaimer: I will be linking to sites in Swedish. A translation extension might be handy!

I, like a lot of people in Stockholm, need to buy an apartment. The rental situation
is bad. Getting a ["first-hand contract"](http://www.findhousingsweden.com/first-hand-contract-forstahandskontrakt-or-hyresratt/) is hard.
I have friends who have even had to
settle for a temporary "third-hand" contract.
So to clarify: The owner leases it to one person, that person subleases it, and then that person subleases it to my friend.

With finding a rental unit out of the picture, buying is the only option.
Buying an apartment in an [inflated market](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/24/where-the-coming-housing-crunch-will-be-most-painful)
during big increases in mortgage rates is not fun position to be in.
So what should a data person such as myself do to identify which areas in Stockholm
are reasonably priced? Plot all the data points on a heatmap! Which is what I set out to do.

My side project [bostadsbussen](https://bostadsbussen.se) scrapes user entered
real estate listings from hemnet and archives them. You can read about the tech behind
it in my [previous blogpost](https://blog.dahl.dev/posts/stringing-together-several-free-tiers-to-host-an-application-with-zero-cost/).

All right, we have a place to host a heatmap. First we need to get the data!

{{< image src="/img/hemnet.jpg" alt="hemnet" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px" >}}

Luckily the data is out there on the internet! [hemnet.se](https://www.hemnet.se/salda/bostader) provides
the closing prices for most of their listings. The problem is that they only return max 2500 results per search query.
So we need to craft some queries to extract all of the 1 million+ results on their site.
It was as simple as limiting the search queries by different parameters until the result
was lower than 2500. Then extracting the data from each listing was easy.

```
I was also very mindful of not putting unncessary load on their servers,
and deliberately chose to not parellelize the scraping.
Getting all the listings took a week in real time.
```

Cool! Now we have a big JSON array with a million data points.
After some quick processing in python I had each property's coordinates, square meter price and
the date it was sold.

Now I want to vizualise this on an interactive map! And share it with the internet!

My first thought was to spin up a dashboarding solution like [metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) or [superset]
(https://superset.apache.org/)
on a rented VM. They are both great tools and it would have been a great option.
But a rented VM that can handle bursty traffic could be quite expensive.
I also don't really want to deal with autoscaling stuff like kubernetes without getting paid ðŸ¤“

So I would need to build the vizualisation myself to get around renting a VM.
I found [deck.gl](https://deck.gl) which
is great for displaying large amounts of data on a map. Perfect! It had support
for React as well, which is what the rest of the site is built with.

We also need some map tiles that we can overlay the vizualisation from deck.gl on.
Mapbox has an excellent free tier where the first 50000 views per month doesn't
cost anything. I doubt I will ever get more traffic than that.

OK, with this built locally on my machine I had a pretty cool visualization.
I think I spent an hour dragging the map around Sweden to see if my
pre-conceived notions about expensive areas was true. It was!
(The Ã–stermalm area in Stockholm is really expensive)

Since the application is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, and everything was built
with React, hosting the visualization there was a no brainer.

But it's not really a visualization if there is no `data` to vizualise.

This leads us to the problem of getting the data to the user.

My JSON array was 25MB compressed with gzip (125MB uncompressed). Hosting it on
an object storage like GCS would cost nothing storage wise. The big problem
would be the egress fees. [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#network-egress)
charges $0.12 per GB. If I got lucky (or unlucky) and had 10000 people download the data,
I would be looking at $30 in just egress fees. Not good for a product with zero revenue!

Luckily [Cloudfare's object storage R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/) has 0 egress
fees. Zero! Now I could use that share the data to the user with a simple GET request.

I ran into some CORS problems for the public bucket
but that was easily solved with this [guide](https://kian.org.uk/configuring-cors-on-cloudflare-r2/).

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

The map could be shared with everyone on internet, without me being worried about waking up to
a huge cloud bill! An additional benefit was that I could [provide the full json data](https://bostadsbussen.se/sold/data).
So other interested parties don't need to hit hemnet.se servers and instead just download that file!

My next steps is to include some line charts for analysis and also make sure the json blob
is updated with new data everyday. Kind of like a serverless dashboard!

I'm also reaching the end of my travel sabbatical (trekking in Nepal was a highlight!).
So I'm looking for a Data Engineering or Data Infrastructure job. Based in Stockholm or EU remote.
